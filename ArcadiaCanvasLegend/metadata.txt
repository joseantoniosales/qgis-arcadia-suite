    1.0.21: BETA 21 - LayerSymbolInfo compatibility fix and centralized version control
    - Fixed 'LayerSymbolInfo' object has no attribute 'get' error
    - Added conversion layer between LayerSymbolInfo and dict format for compatibility
    - Centralized version control with PLUGIN_VERSION variable
    - Enhanced error logging with traceback for better debugging
    - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy system
    - Progressive degradation: Beta 20 -> Legacy -> Emergency mode

    - New SymbolCacheManager with background symbol generation and thread-safe operations
    - Introduced SymbolDataExtractor for centralized QGIS API access abstraction
    - Cache-based rendering system with 1000-item capacity and automatic cleanup
    - Separation of concerns: UI rendering isolated from QGIS API calls
