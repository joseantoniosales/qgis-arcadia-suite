    1.0.22: BETA 22 - Data structure compatibility and debug mode persistence fixes
    - Fixed LayerSymbolInfo missing 'layer' attribute causing "'LayerSymbolInfo' object has no attribute 'layer'" error
    - Added proper LayerSymbolInfo to dict conversion layer with all required attributes
    - Enhanced debug mode persistence - settings now saved and loaded correctly
    - Synchronized debug mode checkbox with actual debug_mode variable state
    - Improved symbol data mapping between LayerSymbolInfo dataclass and legacy dict format
    - Added debug mode state propagation to SymbolDataExtractor
    - Default symbol generation when no symbols found for layers
    - Better error handling and attribute validation in conversion layer
    1.0.21: BETA 21 - LayerSymbolInfo compatibility fix and centralized version control
    - Fixed 'LayerSymbolInfo' object has no attribute 'get' error
    - Added conversion layer between LayerSymbolInfo and dict format for compatibility
    - Centralized version control with PLUGIN_VERSION variable
    - Enhanced error logging with traceback for better debugging
    - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy system
    - Progressive degradation: Beta 20 -> Legacy -> Emergency mode
    1.0.20: BETA 20 - Complete architectural refactoring with cache-based symbol management
    - New SymbolCacheManager with background symbol generation and thread-safe operations
    - Introduced SymbolDataExtractor for centralized QGIS API access abstraction
    - Cache-based rendering system with 1000-item capacity and automatic cleanup
    - Separation of concerns: UI rendering isolated from QGIS API calls
    - Background SymbolGeneratorWorker threads for non-blocking symbol creation
    - Placeholder symbols during background generation process
    - Automatic cache invalidation on layer style changes and layer additions/removals
    - Graceful fallback to legacy system if cache components fail
    - Enhanced stability through architectural redesign based on user crash analysis
    1.0.19: BETA 19 - Ultra-agressive protection against QML style loading crashes
    - Multi-layer protection during paintEvent with global renderer stability checks
    - Extended safety delays (10 seconds for QML loading, 7 for vector changes, 5 for raster)
    - Enhanced QML loading detection by renderer type analysis
    - Improved symbol validation with complex renderer support
    - Ultra-defensive overlay hiding during dangerous style operations
    - Comprehensive layer stability verification before recreation
    1.0.18: BETA 18 - Enhanced protection for QML style loading crashes with extended safety delays
    1.0.17: BETA 17 - Multi-level crash protection and improved recreation algorithms
    1.0.16: BETA 16 - Enhanced crash protection, anti-recreation loops, and defensive programming
    1.0.15: BETA 15 - Improved dock widget integration and comprehensive crash protection
    1.0.14: BETA 14 - Complete overlay recreation system with crash protection
